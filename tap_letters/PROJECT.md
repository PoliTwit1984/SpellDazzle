# Tap Letters Project Architecture

## Project Overview
Tap Letters is a Flutter-based word game that follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns. The project is structured to be maintainable, testable, and scalable.

```

## Core Components

### Models
- **SpawnedLetter**
  - Represents a letter on the game screen
  - Properties: letter, position, gridPosition, spawnTime
  - Used for tracking letter state and position

### Services

#### GameService
- Central game logic coordinator
- Responsibilities:
  - Random letter generation
  - Score calculation
  - Word validation (via DictionaryService)
  - Bonus multiplier calculations
- Key Methods:
  - `initialize()`: Sets up game services
  - `getRandomLetter()`: Letter generation based on frequency
  - `isValidWord()`: Word validation
  - `calculateScore()`: Score computation with bonuses

#### DictionaryService
- Word validation and dictionary management
- Features:
  - Loads words from assets/words_alpha.txt
  - Maintains custom word list
  - Efficient word lookup
- Key Methods:
  - `initialize()`: Loads dictionary asynchronously
  - `isValidWord()`: Checks both dictionaries

### Screens

#### LoadingScreen
- Initial screen while loading game assets
- Handles:
  - Dictionary initialization
  - Service setup
  - Error handling

#### GameScreen
- Main game interface
- State Management:
  - Tracks collected letters
  - Manages game timer
  - Handles scoring and levels
- Key Features:
  - Letter spawning system
  - Word submission
  - UI state management
  - Game over handling

### Widgets

#### CollectedLettersTray
- Bottom panel for letter management
- Features:
  - Drag and drop reordering
  - Double-tap to throw back
  - Clear all functionality
- Props:
  - letters: List of collected letters
  - onClear: Clear callback
  - onReorder: Reorder callback
  - onLetterRemoved: Throw back callback

#### LetterTile
- Individual letter display
- Features:
  - Tap to collect
  - Visual feedback
  - Animation support
- Props:
  - letter: SpawnedLetter object
  - onTap: Collection callback

### Constants

#### GameConstants
- Configuration values
- Includes:
  - Grid dimensions
  - Timing values
  - Letter pool and frequencies
  - Scoring multipliers
  - Custom word list

## State Management
- Uses Flutter's built-in setState for local state
- Stateful widgets for screen-level state
- Services maintain game-level state
- SharedPreferences for persistence

## Asset Management
- Dictionary file loaded via Flutter asset system
- Efficient loading and caching
- Error handling for missing assets

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient word validation using Sets
- Minimal rebuilds using proper widget structure
- Memory management for letter spawning
- Cached dictionary lookups

### Responsive Design
- Grid-based layout system
- Flexible UI components
- Safe area handling
- Dynamic sizing based on screen dimensions

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for missing dictionary
- Debug logging for development
- User-friendly error messages
- State recovery mechanisms

## Future Improvements
1. Add unit and widget tests
2. Implement more advanced scoring system
3. Add sound effects and haptic feedback
4. Create difficulty levels
5. Add multiplayer support
6. Implement analytics tracking
7. Add more word categories/themes
8. Create achievement system

## Development Guidelines
1. Follow Flutter style guide
2. Use meaningful variable names
3. Add comments for complex logic
4. Keep widgets focused and small
5. Test new features thoroughly
6. Document API changes
7. Update FEATURES.md for new features

## Build and Deploy
1. Update version in pubspec.yaml
2. Run tests: `flutter test`
3. Build iOS: `flutter build ios`
4. Build Android: `flutter build apk`
5. Test on both platforms
6. Submit to stores
