## Core Game Mechanics

### Letter System
- **Spawning Algorithm**
  - Letters spawn with weighted distribution based on English language frequency
  - Maintains 4-8 letters on screen at any time
  - Automatic respawning when letters are collected
  - Smart positioning to prevent overlaps

- **Letter Movement**
  - Smooth floating animation with subtle acceleration
  - Collision detection between letters
  - Boundary detection to keep letters in play area
  - Despawn animation when collected

### Word Formation
- **Collection Mechanics**
  - Tap letters to collect them
  - Letters appear in collection tray at bottom
  - Maximum 7 letters can be collected
  - Letters can be reordered in tray
  - Individual letters can be removed by tapping

- **Word Validation**
  - Minimum 3-letter requirement
  - Dictionary validation using pre-loaded word list
  - Invalid words end the game
  - Instant feedback on word submission

### Scoring System
- **Letter Points**
  - Common letters (E, A, I, O, N, R, T): 1 point
  - Less common letters (D, G, B, C, M, P): 2-3 points
  - Rare letters (K, J, X, Q, Z): 4-10 points

- **Word Multipliers**
  - 3 letters: 1.0x (base score)
  - 4 letters: 1.2x multiplier
  - 5 letters: 1.3x multiplier
  - 6 letters: 1.5x multiplier
  - 7+ letters: 1.7x multiplier

## Visual Elements

### Background Design
- **Wave Animation**
  - Two translucent blue waves (12% and 8% opacity)
  - Smooth horizontal movement (13-15 second cycles)
  - Positioned at 35% and 75% screen height
  - Minimal design for optimal readability

### UI Components
- **Letter Tiles**
  - Clean, modern design
  - Responsive touch targets
  - Shadow effects for depth
  - Clear typography

- **Collection Tray**
  - Frosted glass effect
  - Dynamic size adjustment based on letter count
  - Smooth reordering animation
  - Clear visual feedback

### Animations
- **Letter Animations**
  - Smooth floating movement
  - Soft collision responses
  - Fade-out collection effect
  - Scale animations for interactions

- **Score Animations**
  - Point accumulation effects
  - Multiplier displays
  - Achievement popups
  - Round transition effects
